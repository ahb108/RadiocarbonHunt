                    This project asks you to look through fieldwork reports written by commerical
                    archaeological units across the UK who conduct desktop assessments, watching briefs,
                    surveys and full-scale excavations in advance of modern development projects.
                    Radiocarbon dates are sometimes taken as part of this work, but have as yet not been gathered
                    systematically from these reports.
                    The tasks for this crowd-sourcing project can be completed on a desktop computer,
                    laptop or tablet. You can use any web browser, although
                    we recommend Firefox for the best report-searching functions. For any given task, you will be
                    presented with one multi-page fieldwork report. Scroll through it until you find mention of a
                    radiocarbon date. We are
                    looking for the following information for each date (if available):
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="1" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    You will see that we wish you to fill in information about any dates in the spreadhseet columns
                    provided below the report.
                    Brief remarks on the intended role of each column are provided below:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        LabCode: This is the code assigned by the radiocarbon laboratory.
                        For example, for the first date in the example image below your could write "SUERC-16897
                        (GU-16061)".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AgeBP: This is probably the tricky bit. We are looking for the 'uncalibrated' date if
                        possible, seomtimes call the ' C14 Age BP' (BP is before present) of the
                        'conventional age' or the 'uncalibrated age'. The date is often followed by a "±" symbol and
                        then a measure of its accuracy or error (see below).
                        For the first date in the example image below, the AgeBP would be "915". Sometimes a
                        'calibrated' date or dates are mentioned (often expressed as a range BC/AD).
                        You can put these in the Comments column, but please look for an uncalibrated date (which
                        should be present most of the time) to place in the AgeBP column
                        (or otherwise leave the column blank)./li>
                    <li>
                        Error: This is the instrument error associated with the uncalibrated radiocarbon measurment,
                        usually express immediately after a ± symbol.
                        For example in the first date in the example below, you might write "35".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        dC13: This is a common extra measurement used to correct the sampel for different fractions
                        of different carbon isotopes. It is often referred to as "δ13C and in ‰ units".
                        Please simply put the decimal number, not any unit symbols etc. So for example, for the
                        first date in the image below, you would put "-22.2" in the dC13 column.

                        Material: Please enter the material the sample was taken on. For example this is often
                        "bone" or "charcoal" or "grain".
                        Please also put any informaiton about the species, for example "wheat","human" or "oak".
                        Always retain the original wording: if the species is "Hordeum" which refers to barley (as
                        in the example below), please write "Hordeum".
                        If it is says "barley", write "barley". Try to separate material and species by a colon, so
                        for example "grain: Hordeum".

                    <li>
                        SiteName: Please give the name of the site here, complete with county name as well if
                        present
                        (hint: of the site name is in th title of the report)

                        SiteContext: This is for anything relating to the feature on a site from which the sample
                        was taken
                        (e.g. "outer ring ditch", "pit 236" or, in the example below, "context 4/5")

                    <li>

                        a particular date you think is useful. For example, sometimes the type of bone (e.g. radius,
                        ulna) will be mentioned, or a field sample number.

                        Sometimes dates are not as nicely tabulated as in the previous example image.
                        Sometimes instead they are just mentioned in the main text. In such cases,
                        just do your best to add whatever information about the date that you can find in the text.

                        With the Firefox browser and some others, you can use the search function to fin those
                        places in the text which have radiocarbon dates.
                        This often quicker than reading through the whole text which can sometimes be quite long.
                        For example you could search the text for the word "radiocarbon" or for the "±" symbol./li>
                    <li>
                        If for one of the columns in your spreadsheet you cannot find information (e.g. if no
                        mention is made of dC13 values),
                        then just leave that column blank in what you submit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you find no dates whatsoever in the text, please take a second look through the text, but
                        if you are sure then just submit a blank spreadsheet.
                        We have sought to exclude most reports that have no mention whatsoever of a radiocarbon
                        date, but some will remain that do not have any.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can add or remove rows from the spreadsheet by right-clicking in an empty cell fo the
                        table.
                        (or on a Mac computer, holding the ctrl-button and clicking).
