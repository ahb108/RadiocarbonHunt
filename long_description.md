This application asks contributors to search through UK archaeological
fieldwork reports for mention of radiocarbon dates. Lists of such
dates have become increasingly useful to researchers,
above and beyond their immediate role in providing an absolute chronology
for a particular archaeological site. Some people have used them to
model the appearance or disappearance in human history of certain categories of
historical monument more accurately, others to reconstruct past
regional population highs and lows, others to consider patterns of
climate change, and others to understand society's changing emphasis on different
foodstuffs.

Over the last 25 years, there has been an explosion of archaeological
fieldwork in advance of modern development projects (e.g. road
building, house construction, retail outlets, train lines etc.). This
has produced vast amounts of new evidence and a very large number of
published reports about archaeological sites, including many that
contain radiocarbon dates. However,  until recently, these reports were not published
in easily accessibly places and were thus far too
numerous and too scattered for their findings to make it regularly into
mainstream archaeological interpretations of the UK's human
past. However, over the last decade, the Archaeology Data Service (in close
cooperation with individual archaeological companies, county heritage
environment record-keepers and Historic England) has been building up
an open access library of tens of thousands of such development-led
archaeological reports. In this project we seek to extract radiocarbon
data from them, but in principle the same approach might allow us
collectively to enhance the value of these reports in all sorts of
other important ways.

For this particular project, we have already conducted a first check of the entire
report library and identified those reports that are very likely to
contain radiocarbon dates. We now ask for your help with searching
inside a particular report and entering any dates you find into a
database in a systematic way. As always, any such contributions will
themselves also be made publicly available.
